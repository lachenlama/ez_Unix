"locate" is a command to locate a file. You can also use the -i argument to make it case-insensitive.
For example
locate -i diagramm
will search for any file that contains the word "diagramm", whether it is uppercase or lowercase.
Furthermore you can ignor punctuation and spaces (-p), limit the output (-l) or only print the number of found entries (-c) and many more.
