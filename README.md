# ez Unix : Learn Unix the ez way.

Celebrate [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) by getting involved in the open source community by completing some simple tasks in this project. 

## Repository's Aim
* The repository is for Unix commands and their uses. The contributors may add what they wish within the context of being used in Unix Cli. 
* We recommend the contributors to use Cli to clone, write code and push your code to this repository.
* Please mention the command and also its uses by making a dir itself in the repository :
    * for instance, if "ls" is the command you are committing then name the directory file "ls" and writes the commands function as a .md file inside the directory. Add a screenshot of the command and its output if needed.
* Also add the command in the "Commands" section of "README.md" file under the last command. 
* Other than that, the contributors are free to issue a PR with anything related to Cli in this repository.
